ianphil: Reference #file:tutorial.md , in #sym:InMemoryEventStore there is a property called aggregate_events. What is this used for?

GitHub Copilot: The `aggregate_events` dict in `InMemoryEventStore` is just an in-memory index that groups events by their `aggregate_id`.  

• When you call `append_events(aggregate_id, …)`, each new event is both pushed onto the global `events` list and also appended to `aggregate_events[aggregate_id]`.  
• When you want to load or replay a single aggregate you call  
```python
store.get_events(aggregate_id)
```  
which simply returns `aggregate_events.get(aggregate_id, [])`.  

That lets you:  
1. Replay only the events for one aggregate to rebuild its state (`TrainingPlan.from_events(…)`).  
2. Enforce optimistic concurrency (by checking the length of that list as the current version).  

ianphil: So is an aggregate ID used for a training plan?

GitHub Copilot: Yes—every event’s `aggregate_id` is the ID of the TrainingPlan it belongs to. In our tutorial we do:

```python
plan_id = "plan-001"
plan = TrainingPlan(plan_id)
plan.create_plan(…)
# that emits an Event with aggregate_id="plan-001"
```

All subsequent commands (`add_training_block`, `schedule_workout`, etc.) emit events with that same `aggregate_id`, and the `InMemoryEventStore` uses it to group and replay just that plan’s events.

ianphil: explain how `expected_version` helps with concurrency when `append_events` method is called in #sym:InMemoryEventStore class

GitHub Copilot: The `expected_version` parameter is how we implement optimistic concurrency control:

1. When you load an aggregate you also read its current version (e.g. `plan.version` after replaying events).  
2. You execute commands on that in-memory aggregate, which bumps its `version` (and queues up `uncommitted_events`).  
3. When you call  
   ```python
   store.append_events(plan.id, expected_version, plan.uncommitted_events)
   ```  
   you pass in the version you think the store is at.  

Internally `append_events` does:  
```python
current_version = self.get_current_version(aggregate_id)
if current_version != expected_version:
    raise Exception(
      f"Concurrency conflict: expected {expected_version}, got {current_version}"
    )
# otherwise append your events…
```  

• If **no one else** has appended in the meantime, `current_version == expected_version` and your write succeeds.  
• If **another actor** raced you and already wrote new events, `current_version` will have advanced and you’ll get an exception instead of silently clobbering their work.  

That exception signals you to reload the latest history, re-apply your intent on top, and try again—ensuring no lost updates.

ianphil: When are events committed? when is mark_events_as_committed called?

GitHub Copilot: 

ianphil: When are events committed? when is mark_events_as_committed called?, review #file:tutorial.md  looking for this

GitHub Copilot: In this example we only “commit” (i.e. persist) an aggregate’s un-committed events when we call the repository’s save method.  In tutorial.md you can see:

```python
class TrainingPlanRepository:
    def save(self, plan: TrainingPlan):
        if plan.uncommitted_events:
            expected_version = plan.version - len(plan.uncommitted_events)
            self.event_store.append_events(
                plan.id,
                expected_version,
                plan.uncommitted_events
            )
            plan.mark_events_as_committed()    ←→ here
```

So:

  1. You do your in-memory commands on the TrainingPlan (collecting events in uncommitted_events).  
  2. You call repository.save(plan).  
  3. That invokes append_events(…) on the store (actually writing them).  
  4. **Immediately after** append succeeds, mark_events_as_committed() is called to clear the uncommitted_events buffer.

ianphil: in #file:tutorial.md why use the repository pattern? mainly so we don't tie the store directly to training plan's mark events as committed?

GitHub Copilot: The Repository pattern here serves a few purposes beyond simply “not tying the store to the aggregate”:

1. Separation of Concerns  
 - Your `TrainingPlan` remains a pure domain model: it only raises and applies events, never knows about how or where they’re stored.  
 - The `TrainingPlanRepository` handles all persistence concerns (loading, version checks, saving, and clearing uncommitted events).

2. Centralized Concurrency & Versioning  
 - The repo computes `expected_version` and calls `append_events(...)` so you don’t have to sprinkle optimistic-locking logic throughout your domain code.  
 - If you later swap out `InMemoryEventStore` for a real DB, only the repo changes.

3. Unit-of-Work / “Commit” Boundary  
 - The repo’s `save()` is the single place where “uncommitted” events get pushed to the store **and** `mark_events_as_committed()` is called.  
 - That makes it obvious when your aggregate’s changes become durable, and prevents you from accidentally forgetting to clear the buffer.

By using a Repository you keep your domain model focused on business rules, and encapsulate all load/save/versioning/commit logic in one testable, swappable class.

ianphil: using #file:tutorial.md in the #sym:InMemoryEventStore there is a property for events and for aggregate_events. I understand why we want aggregate_events but why events that stores ALL events?

GitHub Copilot: The `events: List[Event]` in addition to the per-aggregate index lets you:

1. Maintain a **global, append-only log** of everything that’s ever happened—across all aggregates—so you can  
   - Replay *all* activity (e.g. for rebuilding read-models or projections)  
   - Audit or export a system-wide timeline  
   - Publish every new event to an event bus or other subscribers  

2. Support **chronological queries** beyond the scope of a single aggregate. Your `get_all_events()` sorts that global list by timestamp, which is exactly what you need for:  
   - Building dashboards that mix events from different plans  
   - Driving time-series feeds or integration pipelines  

3. Keep the **aggregate-scoped store** (`aggregate_events`) lean and fast for the core use-case (replaying just one plan), while still having the full history available for anything “cross-cutting.”
